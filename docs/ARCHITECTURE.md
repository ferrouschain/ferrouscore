## Key Abstractions

### ChainState

Defined in [chain.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/consensus/chain.rs#L28-L35), `ChainState` holds the in-memory view of the active chain:

- `LruCache<Hash256, BlockData>` capped at 2048 entries. Blocks not in the cache are served from RocksDB on demand.
- Height index (height → block hash).
- Tip hash and height.
- `UtxoSet` for validating new transactions.
- `ChainParams` for the selected network.

Key responsibilities:

- `new(genesis, genesis_tx, params)` initializes the chain with a single genesis block and UTXO state.
- `add_block(header, transactions)` validates difficulty, structure, and UTXO rules, then updates chain state and triggers reorgs.
- `reorganize(new_tip)` rebuilds the UTXO set along the new best chain using cumulative work.
- `median_time_past()` computes MTP over up to 11 previous blocks for timestamp rules and mining.

### UtxoSet

Defined in [utxo.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/consensus/utxo.rs), `UtxoSet` is an in-memory `HashMap` keyed by outpoints. It:

- Tracks spendable outputs for all blocks on the active chain.
- Enforces coinbase maturity (via `COINBASE_MATURITY` in [validation.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/consensus/validation.rs#L8-L10)).
- Prevents double spends when applying new transactions.

### Miner

Defined in [miner.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/mining/miner.rs#L10-L14), `Miner` encapsulates:

- Network parameters (`ChainParams`) to compute the current target.
- Mining address (scriptPubKey bytes) to receive coinbase rewards.

Responsibilities:

- `create_coinbase(height, subsidy, fees)` builds a coinbase transaction that commits to the block height in `script_sig`.
- `build_template(chain)` reads chain state under a read lock and returns a `BlockTemplate` (coinbase, transactions, target). Lock is released immediately.
- `solve_template(template)` runs the nonce search in parallel via rayon with no chain lock held.
- `build_template_to(chain, script)` variant used by `generatetoaddress` for a custom coinbase script.

### Network Recovery and Diagnostics

To ensure robustness, the node includes a dedicated recovery system:

- **RecoveryManager**: Monitors network health and detects partitions.
  - Tracks active peer count and last block reception time.
  - Automatically attempts reconnection if isolated (0 peers for >5m or stale tip >30m).
  - Strategies: Query known good peers (AddressManager), fallback to seed nodes, or force full reconnect.
- **NetworkStats**: Aggregates metrics (bytes sent/recv, message counts, ban scores) for diagnostics.
- **Diagnostics**: Provides detailed peer health reports via RPC.

### RpcServer

Defined in [server.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/rpc/server.rs#L8-L12), `RpcServer` owns:

- `Arc<RwLock<ChainState>>` for synchronized access to the chain.
- `Arc<Miner>` for mining operations.
- `Arc<Mutex<Wallet>>` for wallet operations.
- `Arc<PeerManager>` for P2P network control.
- `Arc<RecoveryManager>` for network health monitoring.
- `Arc<NetworkStats>` for metrics.
- `Arc<NetworkMempool>` for transaction pool access.
- A `tiny_http::Server` instance bound to the configured address.

Responsibilities:

- `run()` accepts HTTP requests and dispatches JSON-RPC calls.
- Implements control, wallet, mining, and network methods including `getblockchaininfo`, `getblockhash`, `getblock`, `getbestblockhash`, `getmininginfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getpeerinfo`, `getconnectioncount`, `getnewaddress`, `getbalance`, `listunspent`, `listaddresses`, `sendtoaddress`, `generatetoaddress`, `resetnetwork`, and `stop`.

## Data Flow

### P2P Networking

1. `PeerManager` is initialized and starts listening on the configured port.
2. `NetworkListener` accepts incoming TCP connections and spawns a thread for each.
3. `PeerDiscovery` runs in the background, finding new peers via `getaddr` and `addr` messages.
4. `KeepaliveManager` sends periodic `ping` messages to ensure connection health.
5. Incoming messages are dispatched by `PeerManager` to specialized handlers:
   - `SyncManager`: Handles `headers` and `block` downloads during Initial Block Download (IBD).
   - `BlockRelay`: Propagates new blocks and transactions via `inv`/`getdata`.
   - `PeerDiscovery`: Updates the address book with new peer information.

#### SyncManager (Headers-First IBD)

`SyncManager` tracks progress using a `SyncState` enum:

- `Idle`
- `DownloadingHeaders`
- `DownloadingBlocks`
- `Synced`

### Mining and Block Application

1. The node is started from [examples/node.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/examples/node.rs) with a chosen network.
2. `create_genesis()` builds and mines a genesis block in-memory.
3. `ChainState::new` initializes the chain with genesis and a fresh `UtxoSet`.
4. Block production uses a three-phase split to avoid holding the chain lock during PoW:
   - **Phase 1 (build)**: `build_template(&ChainState)` acquires a read lock, reads the tip, selects mempool transactions, constructs a coinbase, and returns a `BlockTemplate`. Lock released immediately.
   - **Phase 2 (solve)**: `solve_template(BlockTemplate)` searches nonces in parallel via rayon with no chain lock held. `next_block_timestamp` enforces MedianTimePast; `calculate_next_target` computes the difficulty target.
   - **Phase 3 (commit)**: `ChainState::add_block` acquires a write lock briefly to validate and attach the solved block.
5. `ChainState::add_block` validates the new block and connects it:
   - Validates difficulty via `validate_difficulty`.
   - Validates structure and PoW via `validate_block`.
   - Updates `UtxoSet` if the chain is extended or reorganized.
6. If valid, the new block is relayed to peers via `BlockRelay::broadcast_block`.

### RPC Request Handling

1. Incoming HTTP requests are handled by `RpcServer::run`.
2. The body is parsed as JSON and forwarded to `handle_json_rpc`.
3. Depending on `method`, the server:
   - Reads from `ChainState` (e.g. `getblockchaininfo`, `getbestblockhash`, `getblock`).
   - Mutates `ChainState` via mining (`mineblocks`).
   - Queries `PeerManager` (e.g. `getpeerinfo`, `addnode`).
4. Responses are serialized using the structs in [methods.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/rpc/methods.rs) and returned as JSON.

## Thread Safety and Concurrency Model

The node uses a simplified concurrency model relying on `std::sync`:

- `ChainState` is protected by a global `RwLock`, shared between RPC, Mining, and Networking threads. Read-heavy operations (RPC queries, block template construction) hold a read lock; write operations (block application, reorgs) hold a write lock.
- `PeerManager` uses internal `Mutex` locks for its peer map and component references (`Relay`, `Sync`, `Discovery`).
- Background threads:
  - **RPC Server**: One thread per request — `run()` spawns a new thread per incoming request so that long-running calls (e.g. `mineblocks` PoW, ~150s) do not block concurrent requests.
  - **P2P Listener**: One thread accepting connections.
  - **Peer Threads**: Short-lived handshake threads (one per new connection, exits after handshake completes). All post-handshake message reading is done by a single central message-handler loop in `PeerManager` that polls all connected peers.
  - **Maintenance Threads**: Separate threads for `PeerDiscovery` (30s loop) and `KeepaliveManager` (60s loop).
- `Miner` is stateless/immutable configuration wrapped in `Arc`.

Implications:

- **Global Lock Contention**: `ChainState` lock is the primary bottleneck. Long validation or reorganization holds the lock, blocking RPC and P2P processing.
- **Deadlock Risk**: Care is taken to avoid holding the `PeerManager` lock while calling into `ChainState`, or vice-versa.
- **Scaling**: `RwLock` for `ChainState` and per-request RPC concurrency are already implemented. Remaining planned improvements: async I/O for peer threads (currently one thread per peer), and further parallel IBD tuning (multi-peer download with ordered apply, Phase 2/3 complete).

## Dependencies and Rationale

Key external dependencies (see [Cargo.toml](file:///c:/ferrous/Cargo.toml#L7-L17)):

- `sha2`, `ripemd`: Implement `hash160` and `sha256d` without custom crypto.
- `secp256k1`: Provides ECDSA verification for transaction signatures.
- `num-bigint`: Used in difficulty and work calculations.
- `serde`, `serde_json`: JSON encoding/decoding for RPC.
- `tiny_http`: Minimal HTTP server for the RPC interface.
- `clap`: Command-line parsing for the example node binary.

Design choices:

- **No unsafe code**: Enforced at the crate level in [lib.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/lib.rs#L1-L3).
- **In-memory hot path**: `ChainState` maintains an in-memory view of the active chain for validation and mining, while persistence is provided via RocksDB.
- **Explicit serialization**: Custom `Encode`/`Decode` traits in [serialize.rs](file:///c:/ferrous/src/primitives/serialize.rs) avoid relying on `serde` for consensus-critical binary formats.

## Limitations and Future Work

- `ChainState` is guarded by a global `RwLock` and is a known bottleneck under load (RPC timeouts can occur during heavy sync/mining).
- Parallel IBD is in progress: Phase 1 headers-first state machine is deployed; multi-peer download + ordered apply are planned next.
- Address format and wallet/RPC ergonomics are evolving and will change as Dilithium and later privacy features are integrated.
